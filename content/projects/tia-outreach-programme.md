## Introduction

The TIA Outreach Programme is a 3-month physical tutoring initiative designed to provide consistent academic support for secondary school students living in children’s homes. Through weekly in-person sessions conducted by dedicated volunteers, the programme focuses on strengthening students’ understanding of their school subjects and improving their overall academic performance. By bringing tutoring directly to the students, the programme aims to create a reliable and impactful learning experience in a supportive environment.


## Beneficiaries

Our beneficiaries are listed as below:
- Shelter 2 (Girls) at Taman OUG
- Shelter 3 (Boys) at Section 8, PJ



## Collaborations

We are honoured to have collaborated with SHELTER Home for Children for this initiative. This meaningful partnership allowed us to extend our impact directly to the lives of children in need. Through this collaboration, our efforts were focused on providing educational support, emotional encouragement and positive engagement for the children residing at the shelter. We are grateful for the opportunity to work closely with the shelter and contribute to their mission of creating a safe and nurturing environment for every student.


## Sponsorship

The TIA Outreach Programme was proudly sponsored by Aqua-Partners-Aps https://www.aqua-partners.dk/ who contributed a generous amount of RM5,000 to support our initiative.

## Visit to the Beneficiaries

We visited the shelter home during the first week of the TIA Outreach Programme to ensure our tutors were clear on their roles and responsibilities. During this visit, we were also introduced to the students, allowing both tutors and children to get familiar with each other before the start of the programme.



## Project Status

The programme is currently ongoing and is expected to conclude in July. Weekly tutoring sessions are being conducted consistently, with our dedicated volunteers providing academic support and guidance to the children at the shelter home. We look forward to wrapping up the programme with meaningful reflections and positive outcomes for both the tutors and students involved.
