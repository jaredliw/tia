## Introduction to Voices In Action (VIA)

Recognizing the critical role that effective communication skills play in both personal and professional success, we are proud to introduce Voices In Action (VIA). This programme is designed to empower students by equipping them with the techniques, and strategies necessary to express themselves efficiently with confidence. By providing a structured approach to communication, VIA seeks to enhance students’ capabilities, fostering continuous improvement and the refinement of their skills.

The organizing committee of VIA is pleased to announce that this initiative will be conducted as a single-day workshop on 14th June 2025. The programme primarily targets post-SPM 2024 students from a variety of backgrounds, offering them a unique opportunity to develop their communication skills in a focused and supportive environment.

To ensure the effectiveness and impact of this programme, students will participate in a mock presentation at the end of the workshop. This exercise allows participants to apply the skills they have learned and receive constructive feedback from experienced speakers who will guide them in refining their abilities.

Through this initiative, we strive to prepare students for the challenges and opportunities they will encounter in their academic, personal, and professional journeys. Our goal is to cultivate a generation of communicators who are not only capable of expressing their ideas but are also empowered to lead, inspire, and influence in the years to come.
